gitignore
=========

These are the two .gitignore files that I generally use.

I've combined java/scala/eclipse ignores from github/gitignore [https://github.com/github/gitignore] to make it easier for me to pull these in quickly.

to use
======
1) use the following command from terminal: curl https://raw.github.com/jasonray/gitignore/master/JavaScala.gitignore > .gitignore

OR

2) copy/paste like a chump
